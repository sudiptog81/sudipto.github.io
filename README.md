### Introduction

I am a student in a senior secondary school in New Delhi, the Capital of India. I was born in a small town in West Bengal in 1999 and later shifted to New Delhi in 2003. After a decade of living in New Delhi, I have become a quadrilingual, knowing various languages like English, Hindi, Bengali and Sanskrit. Though I am famous in my school, I hate the recognition. I have won many laurels to myself and my school. I have also been a topper for many years. I aim on becoming a cardiologist in future.
